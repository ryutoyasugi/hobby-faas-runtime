# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a hobby FaaS (Function as a Service) runtime project written in TypeScript/Hono/Node.js. The project appears to be in its initial setup phase.

## Development Commands

Since this is a TypeScript project, the following commands will likely be used once the project structure is established:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run a specific test
npm test -- -- -run TestName

# Format code
npm run format

# Vet code for common issues
npm run lint

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the application
npm start
```

## Architecture Notes

As a FaaS runtime, this project will likely include:

- Function execution
- HTTP request routing and handling

The project structure should be organized around these core responsibilities once development begins.

## Project Status

This project is currently in initial setup phase. The CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the architecture and build processes are established.
